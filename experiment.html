		<p ><b>Instructions </b></p>

<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will listen to
40 short utterances and answer questions about them. Please make sure that you can hear the utterances well. <b> If you already did this experiment today (June 25), please do not do it again!</b>

<br>
<br> 
Imagine you are at a party. You walk into the kitchen and overhear Debby, the party host, ask another person something. Here's an example:

<br>
<br>
<b>Debby asks:</b> <br> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload">
  <source src="training-maria1.wav" type="audio/wav">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 

<br>
<br>
Please pay attention not just to <b>what</b> Debby asks, but also to <b>how</b> she asks it.
<br>
<br>
We then ask you, for example: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is Debby certain that Monty skipped the exam? 
<br>
<br>
You must listen to the utterances in order to be able to answer the questions correctly. There are some utterances for which there is a correct answer to the question. We will monitor how you do on those utterances. If you listen and read carefully, you will definitely get those right. 
<br>
<br>
You will indicate your answer on the following scale by clicking the appropriate radio button. <b>Please be sure to align your answers with the full range of the scale, so that  items where you think Debby is not certain are marked "no, Debby is not certain" and items where you think Debby is certain are marked "yes, Debby is certain".</b>
